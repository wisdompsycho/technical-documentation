                <p>Website accessibility is essential in making the internet usable by everyone. When someone describes
                    a site as "accessible", they mean that any user can use all its features and content, regardless of
                    how the user accesses the web — even and especially users with physical or mental impairments.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We
                    traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making
                    sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow
                    network connections.</p>
                <p>Accessibility is the right thing to do. Providing accessible sites is part of the law in some
                    countries, which can open up some significant markets that otherwise would not be able to use your
                    services or buy your products.</p>

            <aticle>
                <p>A great deal of web content can be made accessible just by making sure the correct Hypertext Markup
                    Language elements are used for the correct purpose at all times, which underlines the importance of
                    using semantic HTML (sometimes called POSH, or Plain Old Semantic HTML). This means using the
                    correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.</p>
                <p>For example, you can mark a control button to play a video like this:
                <pre><code>&lt;div&gt;Play video&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
                However, it makes more sense to use the correct element for the job:
                <pre><code>&lt;button&gt;Play video&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
                </p>
                <p>Correct semantic markup has other benefits beyond accessibility:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Easier to develop with</strong> — as mentioned above, you get some functionality for
                        free, plus it is arguably easier to understand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Better on mobile</strong> — semantic HTML is arguably lighter in file size than
                        non-semantic spaghetti code, and easier to make responsive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Good for SEO</strong> — search engines give more importance to keywords inside headings,
                        links, etc. than keywords included in non-semantics, etc., so your documents will be more
                        findable by customers.</li>
                </ul>

            <header>CSS and Javascript accessibility </header>
            <article>
                <p>CSS and JavaScript don't have the same immediate importance for accessibility as HTML, but they are
                    still able to help or damage accessibility, depending on how they are used. To put it another way,
                    it is important that you consider some best practice advice to make sure that your use of CSS and
                    JavaScript doesn't ruin the accessibility of your documents.</p>
                <p>It is possible to use CSS to make any HTML element look like anything, but this doesn't mean that you
                    should. Using correct semantics has a lot to do with user expectations — elements look and behave in
                    certain ways, according to their functionality, and these common conventions are expected by users.
                </p>
                <p>A web developer should:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select sensible font sizes, line heights, letter spacing, etc. to make your text logical,
                        legible, and comfortable to read.</li>
                    <li>Make sure your headings stand out from your body text, typically big and bold like the default
                        styling. Your lists should look like lists.</li>
                    <li>Your text color should contrast well with your background color.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>JavaScript can also break accessibility, depending on how it is used. You should keep unobtrusive
                    JavaScript in mind when creating your content. The idea of unobtrusive JavaScript is that it should
                    be used wherever possible to enhance functionality, not build it in entirely — basic functions
                    should ideally work without JavaScript, although it is appreciated that this is not always an
                    option.</p>
                <p>Good example uses of unobtrusive JavaScript include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Providing client-side form validation, which alerts users to problems with their form entries
                        quickly, without having to wait for the server to check the data. If it isn't available, the
                        form will still work, but validation might be slower.</li>
                    <li>Providing custom controls for HTML videos that are accessible to keyboard-only users, along with
                        a direct link to the video that can be used to access it if JavaScript is not available (the
                        default video browser controls aren't keyboard accessible in most browsers).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>See the example of form validation below:
                <p>HTML</p>
                <pre><code>&lt;label for="name">Enter your name:&lt;/label>
&lt;input type="text" name="name" id="name" />
</code></pre>
                JS
                <pre><code>form.onsubmit = validate;

function validate(e) {
  errorList.innerHTML = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < formItems.length; i++) {
    const testItem = formItems[i];
    if (testItem.input.value === "") {
      errorField.style.left = "360px";
      createLink(testItem);
    }
  }

  if (errorList.innerHTML !== "") {
    e.preventDefault();
  }
}
</code></pre>

            <header>WAI-ARIA basics</header>
            <article>
                <p>WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a specification
                    written by the W3C, defining a set of additional HTML attributes that can be applied to elements to
                    provide additional semantics and improve accessibility wherever it is lacking. There are three main
                    features defined in the spec: roles, properties, and states.</p>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Roles: These define what an element is or does. Many of these are so-called landmark roles,
                        which largely duplicate the semantic value of structural elements, such as
                        <code>role="navigation"</code> or <code>role="complementary"</code>.</li>
                    <li>Properties: These define properties of elements, which can be used to give them extra meaning or
                        semantics. For example, <code>aria-required="true"</code> specifies that a form input needs to
                        be filled in order to be valid, whereas <code>aria-labelledby="label"</code> allows you to put
                        an ID on an element, then reference it as being the label for anything else on the page</li>
                    <li>States: Special properties that define the current conditions of elements, for instance,
                        <code>aria-disabled="true"</code> specifies to a screen reader that a form input is currently
                        disabled.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>An important point about WAI-ARIA attributes is that they don't affect anything about the web page,
                    except for the information exposed by the browser's accessibility APIs (where screen readers get
                    their information from). WAI-ARIA doesn't affect webpage structure, the DOM, etc., although the
                    attributes can be useful for selecting elements by CSS.</p>

            <article>
                <p>With web access on mobile devices being so popular and renowned platforms such as iOS and Android
                    having full-fledged accessibility tools, it is important to consider the accessibility of your web
                    content on these platforms.
                <p>
                <p>These days, mobile devices can usually handle fully-featured websites, and the main platforms even
                    have screen readers built in to enable visually impaired users to use them successfully. Modern
                    mobile browsers tend to have good support for WAI-ARIA, too.</p>
